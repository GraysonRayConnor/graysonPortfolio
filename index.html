			Hello! Thanks for visiting my website! As I’m sure you are aware, considering you’re on a website called graysonconnor.com, my name is Grayson Connor. I am 25 years old and I got into web development about 3 years ago. My journey in web development started when I joined a development bootcamp called Bloc.io. At Bloc, I learned the fundamentals of web development and about how deep the world of web dev goes. Soon after my time at Bloc, I was fortunate enough to land a job working at one the biggest tech companies around (not trying to name drop but it rhymes with shmUber). My time at this aforementioned tech giant was actually incredible. I was able to have a hands on role in many areas of the company (P.R., logistics, data analytics, etc.) and I got to see what goes into making a big machine like that function. Alas, after almost 2 years at Uber (ok there, I said it) 2020 happened. Like many others, COVID-19 claimed my job and I suddenly had an abundance of free time. 
		</p>

			That’s when I said to myself, “I should get back into coding!” You see, at Uber, we used some basic coding as a problem solving tool but, it was certainly not the main aspect of my role. So “getting back into coding” was really more like, “let’s start coding from scratch again.” That’s when stuff got real. I dove head first into teaching (and reteaching) myself everything I could about web development and coding in general.
		</p>

		<p>
			That’s where I’m at now. I’m trying to learn and build as much as I can and I’m loving every minute of it. I’m looking forward to building more complex projects but, more importantly, projects that are truly useful in someones everyday life and work. I’ll keep this site updated with projects that I’ve completed and with projects I’m currently working on. If you’re interested in my skills or just want to chat, don’t hesitate to shoot me an email. Thanks for checking me out!

				<h4><a href="https://apollobaymusic.com">apollobaymusic</a></h4>
				<p>Apollobaymusic.com is a memorial site that I made for a band that I used to be in. Were we the best band ever? That's not for me to say. But the answer is, yes, yes we were. This site features a music and video player and was built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap.</p>

			<div class="projectItm">
				<img src="assets/weather.png">
				<h4><a href="https://weatherbygrayson.com">graysonsweatherapp</a></h4>
				<p>A weather app!? Bet you've never heard of one of those before, have you? This app uses the openweathermap api and the geolocation api to bring you the current weather in your location as well as any city in the world. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="projectItm">
				<img src="assets/ollie.png">
				<h4><a href="https://youthful-wright-e0a21c.netlify.app">ollie v1</a></h4>
				<p>Ready to shred!? Well doesn't matter because you're about to. Ollie v1 is a simple javascript game that let's you test your reflexes and overall gnarliness. Version 2 is coming soon and will feature cleaner and more well rounded gameplay.</p>

			<div class="projectItm">
				<img src="assets/blocjams.png">
				<h4><a href="https://vibrant-sammet-d11770.netlify.app">blocjams</a></h4>
				<p>BlocJams is a music player that I made as part of my education at Bloc.io. It's certainly no Spotify but, I learned an insane amount while making it. Also, this was my first major project that I built from start to finish. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="projectItm">
				<img src="assets/xmasCountdown.png">
				<h4><a href=" https://silly-clarke-96177c.netlify.app/">christmascountdown</a></h4>
				<p>The name says it all. This application simply counts down the days, hours, minutes, and seconds until Santa Claus rises from his icey slumber to B&E homes around the world.</p>
